## POPROX for Researchers
### What POPROX does
POPROX supports researchers in conducting live user studies (aka A/B tests or randomized control experiments) in the area of news recommendation. News is delivered through personalized daily newsletters where experimenters control content and display.
### Advantages of using POPROX
- No need to recruit users.
- No need to scrape content
- No need to manage user accounts / consent / opt-out
### Things to know
- You must supply your own compute.
- You must write your own code.
- You must get human subjects approval from your own institution.
### Priorities
For right now, we are prioritizing experiments from US researchers. We hope to make the service available to a global audience of researchers in the future
### Timeline
- Complete intake form [Intake Form](/documents/intake-form.docx) to describe experiment.
	- Expect to hear back from a POPROX team member within 1 week
- Create experiment design and submit it for approval
	- Approvals may take 1-2 weeks; longer if iteration needed
	- We will also discuss feasible scheduling for your experiment
- Create the code for your experiment and experiment manifest (formal specification)
- Get IRB approval from your institution
- Test code with POPROX platform
- Run experiment / deliver newsletters
- Get results, analyze
- Publish results including datasets, manifest, and optionally code
### Becoming an researcher
The first step to becoming a POPROX researcher is to fill out the [Intake Form](/documents/intake-form.docx). If you'd like to consult with us before doing that, please email the team at [poprox@umn.edu](mailto:poprox@umn.edu) .

If you'd like to learn more about using the platform, see the [researcher documentation](http://docs.poprox.ai)

We also have the slides available from our Tutorial at RecSys 2024: [slides](/documents/poprox-tutorial-recsys-2024.pdf)

### POPROX code
POPROX is open source software hosted on GitHub. The part of most interest to researchers will be the [poprox-recommender](https://github.com/CCRI-POPROX/poprox-recommender) repository, which shows how our recommendation pipeline is built. Researchers are encouraged to fork this repository to start their building their POPROX-compatible experiments.
