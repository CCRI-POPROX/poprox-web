## POPROX for subscribers
### What is the POPROX Newsletter?

POPROX delivers a personalized, ad-free daily newsletter to your inbox with stories from the Associated Press tailored to your interests. POPROX stands for Platform for OPen Recommendation and Online eXperimentation and is the result of a collaboration between five universities, supported by the National Science Foundation. Our goal is to help scientists and journalists explore better ways to select and present news stories. By signing up, you'll get news that matters to you and contribute to important research on personalization and news summarization.

### What POPROX does
- POPROX sends you a personalized daily newsletter.
- POPROX collects your clicks on the articles in the newsletters.
- POPROX learns from this data to give you articles that match your interest.
- POPROX asks you to fill out a short weekly survey with questions about you and/or your opinions about the newsletter.
- Behind the scenes, POPROX allows experimenters to serve you different versions of the newsletter. Your feedback will be used to advance scientific research.

### What POPROX doesn’t do
- POPROX does not show ads (but the articles themselves may include advertising).
- POPROX does not collect personally identifiable data (we use your email address to send you the newsletters, but we won’t share your email address with third parties).
- POPROX does not use or share your data for commercial purposes (only anonymized data will be shared with experimenters, for scientific purposes only).

### What’s this about eXperimentation?
POPROX News is a research platform where researchers can study different ways to personalize and deliver news.
The content and/or appearance of your daily newsletter may change from time to time as you get moved into different experiments. We will ask your permission to put you in any experiments that are intentionally deceptive or harmful.  But experiments to better personalize the newsletter will simply show up and disappear over time. If you really don’t like the newsletters of your current experimental condition, you can opt out using a link at the bottom and we won’t enroll you for that condition again.
