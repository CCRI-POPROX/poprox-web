        POPROX 2.0 presents a new sectioned newsletter with top news and specific topic sections based on your preference profile:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The first section, <strong>Your Top Stories</strong> includes articles from a list of top stories selected by the Associated Press.
            POPROX selects three articles from this list based on your topic preferences, article feedback, and article click history.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Three topical sections</strong>, each focused on a specific topic (e.g., U.S. News, Politics, Entertainment, or Sports).
            The topics are selected based on your topic preferences, and the three articles within each topic are selected based on your article feedback and click history.
        </li>
        <li>
            The last section, <strong>In Other News</strong> includes three additional articles from other topics, selected based on your topic preferences, article feedback, and click history.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The selection of articles will improve over time as POPROX incorporates your article click history and the feedback you provide into the article selection process.
